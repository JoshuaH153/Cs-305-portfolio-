Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? Artemis Financial is a company that deals with financial planning on a global scale. 

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?  when it came to finding and fixing the weak spots in their software. I did this by carefully checking the code and application for vulnerabilities. I emphasized the importance of writing secure code since it's like putting a strong lock on your financial data, preventing hackers from causing trouble. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? It was challenging figuring out all that I was supposed to do but with proper research it was possible. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? In the future I would consult whatever the top brand names are or the top security measures are and look towards them for guidance. I increased layers of security by  adding an encryption algorithm sha-256 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? I made sure by refactoring and continuously testing the code running them through many measures. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? everything I used would be helpful on future assignments or tasks 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? When it comes to showing our skills to potential employers, I can point to this project as an example of my ability to find and fix software vulnerabilities, my understanding of secure coding, and my knack for boosting security, especially when dealing with sensitive financial data.
